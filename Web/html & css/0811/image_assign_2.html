        1. It is the answer no one can give
        It is the work that no one can do
        It's the place where no one dares to go
        It's the life no one could ever know
        In the past I lived with me as Master of my life
        I just didn't see my life was in defeat
        Now I have the Covenant of Christ (In the Lord)
        I can see God's Vision for my life (In the Lord)
        Taking the dream God has made for me I know that
        I can change the frame of the world</p>

        2. And now I know the answer God alone gives
        And now I see the work that God alone does
        It's the place I know where only God can go
        And it is the life given by God alone
        Now I realize that I'm in this Covenant Journey
        I'm living in the Lord I'm happy, all can see
        I will put my faith in practice for Christ (In the Lord)
        He's prepared the masterpiece of my life (In the Lord)
        Taking the road God is leading me on I'll shine the
        light of Jesus Christ in this world</p>
